# Object Detection for Security and Autonomous Systems
This model is capable of classifying images into **11 distinct categories**. It has been designed to enhance **security**, **surveillance**, and **autonomous systems** by detecting objects in real-time. 

### Categories for Detection:
1. Human
2. Airplane
3. Automobile
4. Bird
5. Cat
6. Deer
7. Dog
8. Frog
9. Horse
10. Ship
11. Truck

This object detection system can be deployed for use in a wide range of applications, including **security surveillance**, **autonomous vehicles**, and **aviation safety**.

## 🚀 Features:
- High accuracy in detecting multiple object categories.
- Deployed on **Hugging Face** for easy access and testing via **Gradio**.
- Real-time image classification with easy-to-use API.
